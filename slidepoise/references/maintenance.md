# Maintaining SlidePoise

Use this workflow only when the user explicitly asks to modify the framework, stable skill, or a profile.

1. Identify the layer first. Stable reasoning and host workflow belong in the skill. Runtime mechanics belong in the framework. Configurable design and visual references belong in an external profile. Reusable icons and components belong in shared Library Sets selected by profiles.
2. Never add profile assets or visual references to the installed skill.
3. Modify a profile under `<profiles-root>/<profile-id>`. For user-facing Agent operations, prefer `slidepoise profile create`, `slidepoise profile update`, and `slidepoise profile add-resource`. Use `slidepoise library create` and `slidepoise library add-resource` for coherent icon or component sets. They edit the same installed profiles and catalogs shown by the Console.
4. Remote logos and generic icons stay in a run cache unless the user explicitly requests a persistent profile update.
5. Do not add a script when host-Agent visual reasoning is the correct mechanism. Scripts may measure, transform, package, and check objective contracts.
6. Never encode one slide's IDs, coordinates, wording, bend pattern, or observed defect into generic runtime code.
7. Mechanical checks emit facts, measurements, blocking structural findings, and artifact bindings. They must not emit an overall validity, quality, acceptance, or release verdict. A host-Agent reasoning review consumes this evidence and owns the checkpoint decision.
8. Visually inspect representative rendered outputs whenever behavior can alter appearance. Include connector overlays when connector code changes.
9. Run profile catalog preflight, config preflight, stable boundary audit, targeted Python tests, Node syntax checks, representative OpenCV measurement, generation-context construction, text fitting, Slide Master construction, multi-slide assembly, and a PowerPoint render comparison.
10. Package the stable skill independently. Install or update the framework and profiles with `slidepoise setup`.
11. Treat `references/user-language.md` as the product-wide user language contract. Review new Panel, Console, checkpoint, and generated-artifact copy against it. Use mechanical searches only as evidence. Do not auto-rewrite user-authored content or let a script issue a writing-quality verdict.
12. Keep deck orchestration flexible. Stable slide IDs, ordered scene assembly, and objective package checks belong in runtime. Page count, outline revisions, invalidation scope, review timing, and visual acceptance belong to the host Agent.
